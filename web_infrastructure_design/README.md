## Infrastructure Overview

This project establishes a robust and scalable infrastructure to enhance performance, availability, and security. It encompasses key components such as servers, load balancers, SSL implementation, firewalls, and monitoring tools to create a reliable foundation for web applications.

## Components:

### 1. SSL Implementation

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is employed to encrypt data transmitted between clients and servers, ensuring secure communication over the internet. SSL certificates, issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), authenticate websites and establish secure connections.

### 2. Firewalls

Firewalls serve as a protective barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules, preventing unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.

### 3. Web Server QPS Monitoring

Queries Per Second (QPS) monitoring tools track the rate at which the web server receives and processes client requests. This facilitates the assessment of performance, identification of bottlenecks, and efficient handling of workloads, ensuring optimal server responsiveness.

### 4. Load Balancer

The load balancer acts as a traffic manager, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and prevent overload on any single server. This enhances overall performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## Infrastructure Expansion

When adding additional servers and a load balancer, monitoring becomes crucial. Monitoring tools track server metrics and traffic patterns, ensuring new servers handle workloads efficiently. Monitoring the load balancer helps optimize performance and identify potential bottlenecks, allowing for proactive adjustments to meet user demands effectively.

## Issues and Mitigations

The README highlights potential issues within the infrastructure and provides insights into mitigations. These include concerns related to SSL termination at the load balancer, single MySQL server write handling, and uniformity in server components.

## Project Maintenance

Continuous monitoring, periodic updates, and proactive adjustments are essential for maintaining the performance, availability, and security of the infrastructure. Regularly reviewing and addressing potential issues contribute to the long-term success and reliability of the project.

Feel free to explore the documentation for a deeper understanding of each component and their interactions within the infrastructure. For any questions or issues, please refer to the relevant sections or contact the project maintainers.
