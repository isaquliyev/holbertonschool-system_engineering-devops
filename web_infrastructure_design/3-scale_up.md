## Infrastructure Expansion:

When incorporating additional servers and a load balancer into the infrastructure, monitoring becomes a critical aspect for maintaining optimal performance, availability, and security. Utilizing monitoring tools is essential to track server metrics and traffic patterns, ensuring that the newly added servers handle workloads efficiently. Simultaneously, monitoring the load balancer is crucial to optimize overall performance and identify potential bottlenecks. This proactive approach enables timely adjustments to meet user demands effectively, contributing to a robust and scalable infrastructure.
